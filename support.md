## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**How do I set up my profile?**
When you first open the app, you'll be guided through an onboarding process where you can enter your age, height, weight, activity level, and fitness goals. The app will automatically calculate your personalized nutrition plan.

**How are my calorie and macro goals calculated?**
Your goals are calculated using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation for Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), adjusted for your activity level and fitness goals (weight loss, maintenance, or muscle gain).

### Nutrition Tracking

**How do I log my meals?**
Tap the "Nutrition" tab, then tap the + button to add food. You can use AI-powered food recognition by taking a photo, search the USDA database, or manually enter food items.

**Can I customize my nutrition goals?**
Yes! After completing onboarding, you can adjust your calorie and macro targets in the Profile section.

**How accurate is the AI food recognition?**
The app uses advanced AI (Google Gemini and Apple Vision) to identify foods. For best results, take clear photos with good lighting. You can always edit or adjust the recognized items.

### Fitness Tracking

**How do I log a workout?**
Go to the "Fitness" tab to see your workout program. Tap on a workout session to start logging exercises, sets, and reps.

**Can I create custom workouts?**
The app generates personalized workout programs based on your goals and available equipment. Custom workout creation is planned for a future update.

### Data & Privacy

**Is my data secure?**
Yes, all your health data is stored locally on your device. We do not collect or share your personal health information.
